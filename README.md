# Malware Detection CNN Model

## Overview
This CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Malware Detection Model is designed to classify images of malware using PyTorch. Can be run with either CPU or GPU

### Highest validation accuracy: 
Validation Loss: 0.117, Validation Accuracy: 97.6%

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9.0
- CUDA 11.2 (gpu support)

### Installation Instructions
To set up your environment to run this model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3.9.0 and CUDA 11.2 are installed in your system/environment.
2. Install the required Python packages by running:
   
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Installation
To check the installed packages, you can run:
```python
pip list
```

## Dataset Preparation
Since this program uses ImageFolder to load the dataset, the model expects the dataset to be organized in a specific format with separate directories for training and testing. Each class should have its own subdirectory within these main directories. The script applies necessary transformations to the images to prepare them for the model.

## Model Architecture
The `NeuralNet` class defines the model architecture, which includes:
- Two convolutional layers with ReLU activations and max pooling.
- Two fully connected layers with dropout for regularization.
- A final linear layer for classification.

## Training and Validation
The script demonstrates how to split the dataset, train the model, and validate its performance. It includes functions for training (`train_one_epoch`) and validation (`validate_one_epoch`), along with logging the loss and accuracy metrics.

### Training
To train the model, run the provided training function which iterates over the training dataset and updates the model's weights.

### Validation
After each training epoch, the validation function assesses the model's performance on a separate validation dataset.

## Execution
Execute the script sequentially to train and validate the model. Ensure that the CUDA device is available and selected for training to leverage GPU acceleration.

## Conclusion
This README provides a comprehensive guide to set up, train, and validate the CNN Malware Detection Model. For optimal results, consider tuning the hyperparameters and modifying the model architecture based on your specific dataset and requirements.
