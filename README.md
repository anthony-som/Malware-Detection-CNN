# Malware Detection CNN Model

## Overview
This CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Malware Detection Model is designed to classify images of malware using PyTorch. Can be run with either CPU or GPU. Achieved a Validation Accuracy of 97.6%

### Understanding Malware and Benign Software

#### What is Malware?
Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. By executing malicious tasks, malware can compromise data, steal information, bypass access controls, and cause harm to the system or network. Common types of malware include viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and scareware.

#### What is Benign Software?
Benign software refers to any software that is not designed to harm or exploit a computer system or network. It is safe, non-malicious software that performs useful tasks and operates as intended without any hidden harmful functions. In the context of malware detection, "benign" is often used to describe software or files that are not harmful and do not contain any malicious code or intent.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9.0
- CUDA 11.2 (gpu support)

### Installation Instructions
To set up your environment to run this model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3.9.0 and CUDA 11.2 are installed in your system/environment.
2. Install the required Python packages by running:
   
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Installation
To check the installed packages, you can run:
```python
pip list
```

## Dataset Preparation
Since this program uses ImageFolder to load the dataset, the model expects the dataset to be organized in a specific format with separate directories for training and testing. Each class should have its own subdirectory within these main directories. The script applies necessary transformations to the images to prepare them for the model.

## Model Architecture
The `NeuralNet` class defines the model architecture, which includes:
- Two convolutional layers with ReLU activations and max pooling.
- Two fully connected layers with dropout for regularization.
- A final linear layer for classification.

## Training and Validation
The script demonstrates how to split the dataset, train the model, and validate its performance. It includes functions for training (`train_one_epoch`) and validation (`validate_one_epoch`), along with logging the loss and accuracy metrics.

### Training
To train the model, run the provided training function which iterates over the training dataset and updates the model's weights.

### Validation
After each training epoch, the validation function assesses the model's performance on a separate validation dataset.

## Execution
Execute the script sequentially to train and validate the model. Ensure that the CUDA device is available and selected for training to leverage GPU acceleration.

## Conclusion
This README provides a comprehensive guide to set up, train, and validate the CNN Malware Detection Model. For optimal results, consider tuning the hyperparameters and modifying the model architecture based on your specific dataset and requirements.
